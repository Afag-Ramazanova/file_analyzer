In many countries, the age of crime is getting lower.What are the reasons behind this?
What solutions can be taken to deal with this problem?
Researches show that, in recent years, the age of crime decreased more which means nowadays crimes committed by younger people than the past. In this essay, we will go into details of what can be a cause of this tendency and suggest steps to solve this issue. 
	Due to less guidance and disregard by the parents of children, they tend to be involved in these kinds of activities. In the modern age, parents eagerly try to achieve their work and life balance, but few of them can do it. As a result, children start to spend time on their own and choose their own path which leads to engagement in inappropriate activities. Additionally, young children want to feel and act like an adult, which leads to doing some dangerous things and having an unwanted social circle. An usual outcome of that is drug addiction and to be supported by social circles. 
	Which remedies should be taken to decrease this movement? One step would be for parents to keep an eye on their children, spend their leisure time with them by talking or paying attention to their actions. When doing so, children feel more valuable and responsible for their actions. A further remedy would be to keep children busy with some activities except school, like some painting courses, go in for sports or parents can ask them what they would like to do for giving them independence of choice. By this way, children's brains will be engaged in more useful, crucial tasks and will be free from inappropriate and bad habits.
	To sum up, less parental guidance, feeling like an adult or independence are the main reasons for the decreasing tendency of age of crime, but the problem can be handled by paying more attention to children and keeping children busy with leisure time activities.
